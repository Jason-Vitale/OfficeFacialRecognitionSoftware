This is a facial recognition program that has learned the faces of the characters in the T.V. show "The Office".

Using a convolutional neural network, the program has learned to identify the faces of the main charachters when a video is fed
through the program.

Make sure that you have the libraries downloaded before you use the program to ensure that it works.

In the case that you see a "NotADirectoryError: [Errno 20] Not a directory: 'known_faces/.DS_Store'", 
run
"find . -name "*.DS_Store" -type f -delete" 
in your command line. This should get rid of the .DS_Store issue.

Best to run in VS Code
